// Brazilian CEP "01310-100" (9) — so it cannot share the OLKYPAY cap above. NOTE: this path
// is still payout-bound: sell (BUY_FIAT) payouts copy userData.address into the fiat-output
// creditor (api: fiat-output.service createInternal), so a 9-10 char zip can reach OLKYPAY.
// That residual case must be normalized api-side (createPayer), not by rejecting valid codes
// here. Cap at 10, which still keeps a combined "<postcode> <city>" value out of the field.
