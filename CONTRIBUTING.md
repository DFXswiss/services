## Deviating from these guidelines

These guidelines are binding. A pull request that knowingly does not meet one
of them says so **explicitly in its description**, naming the guideline it
departs from and the reason. An undeclared deviation is not a discussion point
— the pull request is rejected.

A declared deviation is the reviewer's call: they may accept it or refuse it at
their own discretion. Declaring one is not the same as being granted one.

## Pull requests

### Every pull request is self-contained

A pull request lands complete or it does not land. Findings raised in review on
your own pull request are fixed in that pull request — never deferred to a
follow-up. Deferring a fix requires an explicit exception from the reviewer,
granted in writing on the pull request.

A follow-up that exists only as an intention is a follow-up nobody opens. The
next reviewer then finds the same points again and the work is done twice.

### Releases into main

Open feature pull requests against `develop`. CI rejects a pull request into
`main` unless its head is this repository's `develop` (check name `Main only
from develop`).

### Report every bug you find, including pre-existing ones

A defect in code a pull request touches is reported as a bug — with the same
rigour and the same evidence — whether the change introduced it or it was
already there. Age does not make a defect milder, and "pre-existing" is not a
category that demotes it to an observation or puts it out of scope.

Whether a pre-existing bug is fixed in the same pull request is a separate
decision, and it follows the same route as any other deferral above: the
reviewer grants the exception in writing on the pull request. It is never a
reason to leave the bug unreported.

## Compliance AML UI

Manual `amlCheck = Pass` is **Admin-only**. The Compliance UI hides Pass for non-Admin roles
(`canManuallySetAmlPass`); the API is the source of truth and rejects Pass fail-closed for
Compliance and lower. Prefer Fail or Reset so the automatic AML pipeline can re-decide.

## Testing

### A38

This repository requires A38 according to the canonical A38 standard in
[DFXswiss/agent](https://github.com/DFXswiss/agent/blob/278732be433b97096cf5df48b80c3e581446940a/docs/a38.md)
at commit `278732be433b97096cf5df48b80c3e581446940a`. Repo job selection:
`.github/a38.json`. Target-branch applicability and fork workflow approval:
`.github/pr-guard.json`. `dfx pr guard` is
[wired in](https://github.com/DFXswiss/agent/blob/278732be433b97096cf5df48b80c3e581446940a/docs/a38-guard.md#how-fork-github-actions-are-meant-to-work).

This is a **public** repository. GitHub-hosted runners execute the heavy suite
(Jest, `build:dev`, `widget:dev`, handbook smoke, full-stack E2E, CodeQL).
A38 does not replace those GitHub checks. The author report only covers the
light local jobs in `.github/a38.json` (`npm run lint` and
`npm run format:md:check`). Do not run Jest, production builds, widget
builds, handbook Docker, or full-stack E2E locally for A38.

Draft pull requests run the GitHub PR CI jobs (GitHub may hold fork runs as
`action_required`). Ready does not start CI. After a fresh A38 enforce pass on
the current head, `dfx pr guard` approves those waiting initial runs, then sets
Ready when required GitHub jobs are green and the PR is mergeable. The merger
does not click Approve and run workflows. Do not ask a maintainer to approve
workflow runs. Post the light A38 report on the current head.

### Test architecture

`docs/test-architecture.md` describes the test layers this repository owns, with
measured numbers for the current state, and points at the canonical
cross-repository description in `DFXswiss/backend`. Read it before adding a test
layer, moving a test between layers, or extending the full-stack harness. (Given
as a path rather than a link on purpose: the handbook build renders every markdown
file to HTML, and its integrity check then requires every relative reference
beginning with `docs/`, `assets/` or `screenshots/` to exist in that output — which
a reference to a `.md` file never does, since only the rendered `.html` is there.
References outside those three prefixes are unaffected, which is why the link to
`e2e-stack/README.md` further down is fine.)

Two obligations follow from it for every pull request:

- **A failure mode is tested at the lowest layer that can express it.** A case
  reachable against a real database does not belong in a browser test, and the
  processing chain behind the API is not testable from this repository at all.
- **Reality declaration.** Whenever a pull request introduces, removes or changes
  a fake — a faked external provider, a disabled cron job, a schema built without
  the migration chain, state written directly with SQL, a placeholder value that
  looks real, a suppressed side effect, or a seed correction that bends reality —
  the declaration changes in the same pull request, and each entry says in one
  plain sentence what a green run does **not** prove. Write the entry before
  building the fake. A pull request that adds a fake without its declaration is
  incomplete regardless of whether CI is green.

### Unit tests

```
npm run test
```

Draft pull requests run the PR CI jobs (GitHub may hold fork runs as
`action_required`). Ready does not start CI. After a fresh A38 enforce pass on
the current head, `dfx pr guard` approves those waiting initial runs. Do not
ask a maintainer to approve workflow runs. When the job runs, develop PRs
without `ci:full` run Jest `--findRelatedTests` on changed files under `src/`
and `functions/`. A PR with no such files and no full-run trigger records
`mode=none` and skips the suite without failing. Apply `ci:full` to force the
full suite, as do PRs into `main`, a bare `workflow_dispatch`, unsafe path
characters, test/build infrastructure, and deleting or renaming files under
`src/` or `functions/`. Lint, Markdown formatting (`format:md:check`),
`build:dev` and `widget:dev` always run in full when the job runs. A standard
PR into `develop` (no `ci:full`) must finish CI in under 10 minutes wall-clock;
the full-stack E2E job is an in-job no-op unless `ci:full` is set. Full-stack
E2E is called from PR CI after Build and test succeed, so it cannot start
while unit tests are still queued. Full runs (`ci:full`, PRs into `main`, a
bare `workflow_dispatch`) may take longer.

#### Coverage

Every file a pull request touches must reach **100 % statement, branch, function
and line coverage**, for every file Jest instruments — `src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`
minus `src/**/*.d.ts`, the two globs `collectCoverageFrom` in `package.json` is
built from. Translation JSON, lock files, assets, type declarations and
documentation carry no coverage and are not measured. Measure per file:

```
npm run test -- --coverage --collectCoverageFrom='src/screens/example.screen.tsx'
```

Partial coverage hides exactly what a code review cannot see either: error paths,
guard clauses and the state combinations a screen only reaches in production. If
a line genuinely cannot be exercised, delete it rather than excluding it from the
measurement.

CI runs the suite without a coverage gate, so this is a review gate, not an
automated one: state the per-file numbers in the pull-request description and let
the reviewer check them against the diff. Most files in this repository are far
below the mark today, so touching a long-neglected one means bringing that whole
file up — plan for it rather than discovering it in review.

### Visual regression tests (Playwright)

The Playwright end-to-end tests under `e2e/` render the app and compare
screenshots against committed baselines in `e2e/screenshots/baseline/`.

**These tests are a local development and code-review aid. They intentionally do
NOT run in CI.**

Their purpose is review quality: when a change affects the UI, the author
regenerates the affected screenshots locally and commits them together with the
change. The reviewer then sees the visual difference (before → after) directly in
the pull-request diff, instead of having to infer it from the code. Running them
in CI would add no value for that purpose and would be flaky — the baselines are
platform-, font- and data-dependent — needlessly blocking PRs.

#### Workflow

1. Start the local stack. See the API repository's README quick start (local
   database via `docker compose up -d`, then `npm run setup`). The API and this
   repository must be checked out as sibling folders.
2. Run the relevant test(s) against the local API:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000 npx playwright test <spec> --project=chromium
   ```
3. When your change affects the UI, regenerate the affected screenshots and commit
   them with the change:
   ```
   npx playwright test <spec> -g "<test title>" --update-snapshots
   ```

#### Rules

- Regenerate only the screenshots your change actually affects — never update all
  baselines at once.
- Baselines are platform-specific (`*-chromium-darwin.png`); generate them on the
  same platform as the existing ones (macOS).
- Baselines for screens you did not touch may not match the current app, because
  the screen or the local seed data has drifted since the baseline was taken. That
  is expected — these tests are not a regression gate and do not fail the build.
- For a clean, reviewable diff, regenerate on a realistic data set so the
  screenshot isolates your actual UI change rather than seed-data noise.

## Handbook

The handbook assembles the committed Playwright baselines, the design tokens and
the Markdown documentation of this repository into a static site. It is built by
`scripts/handbook/build.js`; see `docs/handbook/README.md` for the sources and
the build guards.

**Handbook coverage must be complete.** Every screen or flow a pull request
changes has to be represented there:

- a committed Playwright baseline under `e2e/screenshots/baseline/`, covering each
  visual variant the change introduces — for example both sides of a device or
  mode split, not just the one you happened to look at, and
- an entry in `scripts/handbook/metadata.json` giving the flow a title and a
  description.

If the screen you touched has no baseline yet, create one. That is the case this
rule exists for, and it does not conflict with "regenerate only the screenshots
your change actually affects" above: a screen you changed is affected, whether or
not it had a baseline before. `--update-snapshots` writes missing baselines as
well as changed ones, so the same command covers both. If the screen has no spec
at all, add one next to the existing specs in `e2e/` — a spec that navigates to
the screen and takes one `toHaveScreenshot` per visual variant is enough.

The build itself does not enforce any of this: it guards a global screenshot and
document floor, and a missing `metadata.json` entry is accepted silently, falling
back to a title derived from the file name — only an orphaned entry, one with no
matching screenshots, produces a stderr warning (see `docs/handbook/README.md`).
Completeness is therefore checked in review, and `handbook-check.yaml` does not
even run on a pull request that touches application code under `src/` and nothing
else: its path filter covers `src/static/assets/**` and no other path below `src/`.

## API access goes through the SDK

Every API call that `@dfx.swiss/react` already encapsulates must go through the
SDK. Do not hand-build an API URL and fire it with `fetch`, and do not fall back
to a raw `useApi().call` for a call the SDK covers.

If an SDK hook is missing a parameter or an endpoint, the fix belongs in the SDK
(DFXswiss/packages, `packages/react/src/hooks/`): add it additively so existing
callers stay source-compatible, release it, then consume it here. Working around
it at the call site moves endpoint knowledge — verb, query shape, response type —
into this repository, where it goes stale silently: the SDK gets updated, the call
site does not, and `call<T>()` type-checks against the generic you asserted
yourself, so nothing fails at build time.

## Full-stack E2E tests

The full-stack harness under `e2e-stack/` runs the real frontend, API, and
Postgres together (external providers are mocked). Unlike the visual-regression
suite under `e2e/` — see [Visual regression tests (Playwright)](#visual-regression-tests-playwright)
above, which does not run in CI — this harness is called from PR CI after Build
and test succeed. Draft pull requests run the job (GitHub may hold fork runs as
`action_required`). Ready does not start CI. After a fresh A38 enforce pass on
the current head, `dfx pr guard` approves those waiting initial runs. Do not
ask a maintainer to approve workflow runs. A develop PR without `ci:full`
records `mode=none` and does not bring the stack up (the job still runs). Apply
`ci:full`, target `main`, or run a bare `workflow_dispatch` to force a full run.

A pull request that changes a screen or an API contract should bring or update
the matching full-stack test.

Coverage of the route tree is enforced, not tracked by hand. The suite reads the
route definitions out of `src/App.tsx` and fails if a route is claimed by no test
file or by more than one, and — on a full run (`E2E_FULL_RUN=1`, which CI sets
whenever it brings the stack up) — if a route
was never actually opened by any test. The browser records every navigation it
makes, and the gate compares that recording against the route list, so a claim
pointing at a file that never visits the route does not satisfy it. Adding a route
therefore means adding a claim in `e2e-stack/specs/registry/` and a test that
navigates there. That gate runs only when the stack comes up (`ci:full`, a PR
into `main`, or a bare `workflow_dispatch`); a standard develop PR without
`ci:full` does not enforce it.

Run locally:

```
npm run e2e:stack
```
